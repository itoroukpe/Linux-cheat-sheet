**Scenario:**

Abiola, a DevOps engineer, has been tasked with auditing the company's Linux server to identify and manage specific files that meet certain criteria. The objectives are as follows:

1. **Identify Large Log Files:**
   - Locate all log files (`*.log`) within the `/var/log` directory and its subdirectories that are larger than 100MB.

2. **Find Recently Modified Configuration Files:**
   - Search for all configuration files (`*.conf`) in the `/etc` directory that have been modified in the last 7 days.

3. **Locate Empty Directories:**
   - Identify all empty directories within the `/home` directory.

4. **Search for Specific Content in Scripts:**
   - Find all shell scripts (`*.sh`) in the `/usr/local/bin` directory containing the string `TODO`.

5. **Identify Files with Specific Permissions:**
   - Locate all files in `/opt/projects` with permissions set to `777`.

**Assignment Tasks:**

For each of the objectives above, Abiola should:

- **Construct the appropriate Linux `find` command(s)** to achieve the objective.
- **Execute the command(s)** on a Linux system to verify their correctness.
- **Document the command(s)** used and explain the purpose of each option and argument.
- **Summarize the findings** for each objective, detailing the files or directories identified.

**Deliverables:**

- A report containing:
  - The `find` command(s) used for each objective.
  - An explanation of each command, including a breakdown of options and arguments.
  - A summary of the results obtained from executing each command.

**Additional Notes:**

- Abiola should ensure that he has the necessary permissions to access and search the specified directories.
- For commands that may produce extensive output, it's advisable to redirect the results to a file or use pagination tools like `less` for easier analysis.
- Safety precautions should be taken when dealing with files, especially when identifying files with `777` permissions, to avoid unintended security risks.

**Objective:**

This assignment aims to enhance Abiola's proficiency with Linux file searching commands, particularly the `find` command, and to develop his ability to construct complex search queries to manage and audit files effectively in a Linux environment.
