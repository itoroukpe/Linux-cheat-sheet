**Scenario:**

Luke, a system administrator, has noticed that his Linux server is experiencing high CPU usage, leading to performance degradation. He needs to identify the processes consuming excessive resources and take appropriate actions to restore optimal performance.

**Tasks:**

1. **Monitor System Processes:**
   - Use the `top` command to display real-time information about system processes, including CPU and memory usage.
   - Identify the processes that are consuming the most CPU resources.

2. **List All Running Processes:**
   - Utilize the `ps` command with appropriate options to generate a detailed list of all running processes.
   - Filter the output to focus on processes with high CPU or memory usage.

3. **Adjust Process Priority:**
   - Select a process that is consuming significant CPU resources but is not critical to immediate operations.
   - Use the `nice` command to start a new instance of this process with a lower priority, or the `renice` command to adjust the priority of an already running process.

4. **Terminate Unresponsive Processes:**
   - Identify any processes that are unresponsive or causing system instability.
   - Use the `kill` command to terminate these processes gracefully. If a process does not terminate with a standard kill signal, use a stronger signal to force termination.

5. **Manage Background Processes:**
   - Identify processes that can be moved to the background to free up the terminal.
   - Use job control commands such as `bg` to resume stopped jobs in the background and `fg` to bring background jobs to the foreground when needed.

6. **Monitor Process Tree:**
   - Use the `pstree` command to view the hierarchical structure of running processes.
   - Identify parent-child relationships among processes to understand process dependencies and manage them effectively.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- Luke should be able to monitor and interpret real-time process data to identify resource-intensive processes.
- He should demonstrate the ability to adjust process priorities to optimize system performance.
- Luke should effectively terminate unresponsive or problematic processes using appropriate signals.
- He should manage foreground and background processes to maintain control over the system's workflow.
- Luke should understand the process hierarchy and dependencies within the system.

**Reference Commands:**

- `top`
- `ps`
- `nice`
- `renice`
- `kill`
- `kill -9`
- `bg`
- `fg`
- `pstree`

**Note:** Ensure that Luke understands the implications of each command and uses them responsibly to maintain system stability.

Here are the solutions to the tasks outlined in the process management scenario:

**1. Monitor System Processes:**

- **Command:** `top`

- **Usage:** Execute the `top` command in the terminal to display real-time information about system processes, including CPU and memory usage.

- **Steps:**
  - Open the terminal.
  - Type `top` and press Enter.
  - Observe the list of processes, focusing on the `%CPU` and `%MEM` columns to identify processes consuming the most resources.

**2. List All Running Processes:**

- **Command:** `ps aux`

- **Usage:** The `ps` command with `aux` options provides a detailed list of all running processes.

- **Steps:**
  - In the terminal, type `ps aux` and press Enter.
  - Review the output, which includes columns such as USER, PID, %CPU, %MEM, and COMMAND.
  - To filter processes with high CPU usage, you can use:
    ```
    ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 10
    ```
    This command lists the top 10 processes by CPU usage.

**3. Adjust Process Priority:**

- **Commands:** `nice` and `renice`

- **Usage:**
  - To start a new process with a lower priority, use `nice`.
  - To change the priority of an existing process, use `renice`.

- **Steps:**
  - **Starting a New Process with Lower Priority:**
    - Use the `nice` command with a positive niceness value (e.g., 10):
      ```
      nice -n 10 command_name
      ```
    - This starts `command_name` with a lower priority.
  - **Changing Priority of an Existing Process:**
    - Identify the PID of the target process using `ps` or `top`.
    - Adjust its priority:
      ```
      renice +10 -p PID
      ```
    - This increases the niceness value, thereby lowering the process's priority.

**4. Terminate Unresponsive Processes:**

- **Commands:** `kill` and `kill -9`

- **Usage:**
  - To terminate a process gracefully, use `kill` with the process ID (PID).
  - If the process does not terminate, use `kill -9` to forcefully terminate it.

- **Steps:**
  - Identify the PID of the unresponsive process using `ps` or `top`.
  - Terminate the process gracefully:
    ```
    kill PID
    ```
  - If the process remains unresponsive, forcefully terminate it:
    ```
    kill -9 PID
    ```

**5. Manage Background Processes:**

- **Commands:** `bg`, `fg`, and `jobs`

- **Usage:**
  - Use `bg` to resume a stopped job in the background.
  - Use `fg` to bring a background job to the foreground.
  - Use `jobs` to list current jobs.

- **Steps:**
  - **Listing Jobs:**
    - Type `jobs` in the terminal to see a list of current jobs with their statuses.
  - **Moving a Stopped Job to the Background:**
    - If a job is stopped (e.g., after pressing `Ctrl+Z`), resume it in the background:
      ```
      bg %job_number
      ```
  - **Bringing a Background Job to the Foreground:**
    - To bring a background job to the foreground:
      ```
      fg %job_number
      ```

**6. Monitor Process Tree:**

- **Command:** `pstree`

- **Usage:** The `pstree` command displays processes in a tree format, showing parent-child relationships.

- **Steps:**
  - In the terminal, type `pstree` and press Enter.
  - Review the hierarchical structure to understand process dependencies.
  - To include PIDs in the output:
    ```
    pstree -p
    ```

By following these steps, Luke can effectively manage system processes, identify resource-intensive tasks, adjust process priorities, terminate unresponsive processes, and understand process hierarchies to maintain optimal system performance.
