**Scenario: Organizing Project Files with Linux File Management Commands**

**Background:**

Alice is a DevOps engineer working on a new project. She needs to set up a structured directory environment to organize her project files efficiently. This involves creating directories, navigating through them, managing files, and setting appropriate permissions using Linux commands.

**Tasks:**

1. **Navigate to the Home Directory:**
   - Alice should start by ensuring she is in her home directory.
   - **Command:** `cd ~`

2. **Create a Project Directory Structure:**
   - Within her home directory, Alice needs to create the following directory hierarchy:
     ```
     project/
     ├── src/
     ├── docs/
     └── tests/
     ```
   - **Commands:**
     - `mkdir project`
     - `cd project`
     - `mkdir src docs tests`

3. **Create Empty Files:**
   - In the `src` directory, Alice should create three empty files: `main.py`, `utils.py`, and `config.py`.
   - **Commands:**
     - `cd src`
     - `touch main.py utils.py config.py`

4. **List Files with Detailed Information:**
   - Alice wants to view the files in the `src` directory with detailed information, including permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.
   - **Command:** `ls -l`

5. **Set Permissions:**
   - Alice needs to ensure that only she can read and write the files in the `src` directory, while others should have no access.
   - **Command:** `chmod 600 *.py`

6. **Move Files:**
   - Alice decides to move `config.py` from the `src` directory to the `docs` directory for better organization.
   - **Commands:**
     - `mv config.py ../docs/`
     - `cd ../docs`
     - `ls` (to verify the file has been moved)

7. **Copy Files:**
   - Alice wants to create a backup of `main.py` in the `tests` directory.
   - **Command:** `cp ../src/main.py ../tests/main_backup.py`

8. **Remove a File:**
   - After reviewing, Alice decides to delete `utils.py` from the `src` directory.
   - **Command:** `rm ../src/utils.py`

9. **Display File Content:**
   - Alice wants to quickly view the content of `main_backup.py` without opening an editor.
   - **Command:** `cat ../tests/main_backup.py`

10. **Clean Up:**
    - After completing her tasks, Alice decides to remove the entire `project` directory and its contents.
    - **Command:** `cd ~`
    - **Command:** `rm -r project`

**Objective:**

Through this scenario, Alice will demonstrate proficiency in essential Linux file management commands, including `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `ls`, `chmod`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, and `cat`. These commands are fundamental for efficient file and directory management in a Linux environment.

**Note:**
```
It's crucial to execute these commands carefully, especially those that modify or delete files and directories. Always ensure you're operating in the correct directory and that you have backups of important data before performing operations that cannot be undone.
```
