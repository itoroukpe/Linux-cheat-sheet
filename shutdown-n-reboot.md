**Scenario:**

Ben is a system administrator responsible for maintaining a Linux-based server that hosts critical applications for his company. To ensure optimal performance and security, he needs to apply important system updates and kernel patches. These updates require a system reboot to take effect. However, the server is accessed by multiple users across different departments, and an unexpected reboot could disrupt their work.

**Problem:**

Ben must reboot the server to apply essential updates, but he wants to minimize disruption to active users. He needs to notify all logged-in users about the impending reboot, schedule it at a convenient time, and ensure that users have enough time to save their work and log off safely.

**Tasks:**

1. **Notify Users of the Scheduled Reboot:**
   - Ben should broadcast a message to all logged-in users informing them of the scheduled reboot. He can use the `shutdown` command with appropriate options to send this notification.

2. **Schedule the Reboot:**
   - Ben needs to schedule the reboot at a specific time when user activity is minimal, such as after business hours. He should use the `shutdown` command to set the exact time for the reboot.

3. **Cancel the Scheduled Reboot (if necessary):**
   - If there's a need to abort the scheduled reboot due to unforeseen circumstances, Ben should know how to cancel it using the appropriate command.

**Instructions:**

- **Broadcasting a Notification:**
  - To notify all users of the impending reboot in 30 minutes with a custom message, Ben can use:
    ```bash
    sudo shutdown -r +30 "Attention: The system will reboot in 30 minutes for essential updates. Please save your work and log off."
    ```
    - `-r` indicates that the system will reboot.
    - `+30` schedules the reboot to occur in 30 minutes.
    - The message in quotes will be broadcast to all logged-in users.

- **Scheduling the Reboot at a Specific Time:**
  - To schedule the reboot at 10:00 PM, Ben can execute:
    ```bash
    sudo shutdown -r 22:00 "Attention: The system will reboot at 10:00 PM for essential updates. Please save your work and log off."
    ```
    - `22:00` specifies the time in 24-hour format.

- **Canceling the Scheduled Reboot:**
  - If Ben needs to cancel the scheduled reboot, he can run:
    ```bash
    sudo shutdown -c "The scheduled system reboot has been canceled. Please continue your work."
    ```
    - `-c` cancels the scheduled shutdown/reboot.
    - The cancellation message will be broadcast to all users.

**Considerations:**

- Ben should ensure he has the necessary administrative privileges to execute these commands.
- It's crucial to choose a reboot time that minimizes disruption, typically during maintenance windows or periods of low activity.
- Communicating clearly with users helps prevent data loss and ensures they have adequate time to prepare for the reboot.
